      <h5>How do I use this website?</h5>
      <hr>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose a Pokémon by selecting one from the dropdown menu. You can also type the Pokémon's name;
          once you specify enough letters in the name, the name should automatically appear in the dropdown menu.
        </li>
        <li>Once you specify the Pokémon's name, you can decide if you want the Pokémon to appear shiny or not shiny.
          Note that the only difference between a shiny and non-shiny Pokémon is the Pokémon's color.
        </li>
        <li>When you are ready, press the "Add Pokémon" button. Your Pokémon's stats should now appear!</li>
        <li>You can view the stats of multiple Pokémon at once, so you can repeat this process as many times you want.</li>
      </ol>

      <h5>What are base stats?</h5>
      <hr>
      <p>Base stats are once of the most important indicators of a Pokémon's competitive strength. There are six base
        stats for each Pokémon:
        HP (hit points), Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk (Special Attack), Sp. Def (Special Defense), and Speed. Each of these
        base stats is a number from 1 to 255; the higher the number, the more powerful the Pokémon is in terms
        of that base stat.</p>
      <p>Note that legendary Pokémon tend to have very high base stats. Additionally, Pokémon that belong
        to the beginning or middle of their evolution line tend to have low base stats.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-section">
      <h5>How do I know if a Pokémon's base stats are good?</h5>
      <hr>
      <p>In terms of competitive Pokémon, most Pokémon in the metagame will have one or two base stats that are greater
        than 100-110.
        However, although base stats are extremely important, Pokémon can still be competitively viable even if their base
        stats are mediocre.
        For example, although Clefable's base stats do not look spectacular, it is still powerful because of its
        exceptional type,
        abilities, and movepool.</p>
      <p>If you have no interest in playing competitive Pokémon (e.g., Smogon and VGC), I think it is important that you
        play with your favorite Pokémon rather than Pokémon with high base stats.</p>

      <h5>What if I do not know what an ability/move does?</h5>
      <hr>
      <p>To get more information about a particular ability or move, all you have to do is click on the name of the ability/move.
        You will be directed to a webpage from Serebii (a popular Pokémon database) that will describe the ability/move.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-section">
      <h5>What counts as a "notable move"?</h5>
      <hr>
      <p>The most notable moves are the ones that the Pokémon learns the latest. For example, since the last two moves
        Infernape learns are
        Flare Blitz and Calm Mind, the first two moves in Infernape's Notable Moves section are Flare Blitz and Calm Mind.
        Note that this
        algorithm may change later.</p>

      <h5>How did you collect data on every single Pokémon?</h5>
      <hr>
      <p>I used PokéAPI, a very popular API. Feel free to explore the <a class="link" target="_blank"
          href="https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2">documentation</a>; I found the "Pokemon" endpoint to be to the most useful
        when collecting a lot of information about a single Pokémon.</p>
